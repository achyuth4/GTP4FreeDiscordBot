# GTP4FreeDiscordBot
A Discord bot that uses the gpt4free API to integrate it right into Discord using slash commands.


# Update:
I have been working on fixing this over the past few days as there have been many changes with the the discord.py and the GPT4Free libraries but I keep running into issues. I will upload everything here when I am done.
